jMakeOdf is a tool that help with organ definition files (ODF) creation for
the virtual pipe organ software GrandOrgue. It's a java software based on
(or partly ported from) the make_odf software by Jean-Luc Derouineau (jlder).

The software is a commandline tool that require a specification file placed
in the folder where the final ODF will be placed and the program itself must
also be run from that same location with that specification file as a 
parameter. Read the USAGE_GUIDE.txt file for more information and also look 
at the definition_example.txt.
